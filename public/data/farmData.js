We concentrate on taking care of the land while letting it take care of us. Our garden provides sustainably and organically-grown crops. Our vegetables are mostly heirloom varieties, raised with homemade compost and without the use of artificial pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers or plastic mulches of any kind. All of our animals -- chickens, pigs, cows, and lambs -- are pasture-raised antibiotic and hormone-free. Our heritage-breed chickens are also free-range and provide both meat and eggs. Our beef and lamb are 100% grass-fed and finished. We love what we do and hope you do too!",

We  introduced a Red Devon bull to the herd to enhance the taste and tenderness of the meat. The Red Devon is a heritage breed from New Zealand, superbly suited to grass feeding. Our herd lead stress-free lives on about 40 acres of pasture, with free access to water and shade. We do not use any hormones, antibiotics, or grains. The herd stays healthy due to the lack of crowding, free-range pasture, and careful management by Rob.  Rob uses organic fish-based nutrients to fertilize the pastures.      ",
