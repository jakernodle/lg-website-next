However, the Bush-N-Vine Farm has actually been in the Hall family for much longer---over 150 years! Originally the farm was solely a peach orchard. The building located on our farm in York, South Carolina was used as a peach packing shed in the 1950's and 60's. In 1979, Bob Hall reopened the doors using the space as an open air market. After graduating from Clemson University in 1980 Bob made farming his career. He has been selling delicious produce in the stand ever since. His hard work and dedication to farming are the reason Bush-N-Vine Farm is what it is today! In 2010, after graduating from Clemson University, Sam Hall joined forces with his dad and started working at the farm full-time. We hope that our family farm will continue providing our customers with the fresh produce they love for many years to come!      ",

We  introduced a Red Devon bull to the herd to enhance the taste and tenderness of the meat. The Red Devon is a heritage breed from New Zealand, superbly suited to grass feeding. Our herd lead stress-free lives on about 40 acres of pasture, with free access to water and shade. We do not use any hormones, antibiotics, or grains. The herd stays healthy due to the lack of crowding, free-range pasture, and careful management by Rob.  Rob uses organic fish-based nutrients to fertilize the pastures.      ",

During this time members will receive a weekly box of fresh produce. Our goal is to provide a wide variety of vegetables while also including them in a quantity that allows them to be a meaningful addition to your diet. What we offer is generally what is in season, though we have some season extension with a hoop-house. Each box includes a selection of vegetables along with herbs, cut flowers and fruit (when in season). We go to great lengths to adhere to organic and sustainable principals of farming and use no pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Our laying hens live in family groups on pasture and our production practices are Animal Welfare Approved. In order to minimize waste we build the box you receive and will be hand crafting many of the containers that carry your fare. ",
